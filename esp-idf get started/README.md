## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone the ESP-IDF repository:
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `esp-idf` directory:
   ```bash
   cd esp-idf
   ```
3. Run the installation script for your operating system:
   - **Windows:** `install.bat`
   - **macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     ./install.sh
     ```
4. Add ESP-IDF tools to your path:
   ```bash
   source export.sh
   ```

## Building and Flashing Your First Project

1. Navigate to the `hello_world` example:
   ```bash
   cd examples/get-started/hello_world
   ```
   ![Hello World Example](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/_images/hello-world-example.png)

2. Copy the project to a new directory for customization:
   ```bash
   cp -r hello_world ~/esp_projects/my_first_project
   cd ~/esp_projects/my_first_project
   ```
3. Configure the project:
   ```bash
   idf.py menuconfig
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   idf.py build
   ```
   ![Build Output](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/_images/build-output.png)

5. Flash the firmware to the ESP32:
   ```bash
   idf.py -p [PORT] flash
   ```
6. Monitor the serial output:
   ```bash
   idf.py monitor
   ```
   Press `Ctrl+]` to exit the monitor.
