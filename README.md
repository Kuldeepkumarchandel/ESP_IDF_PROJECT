# ESP32 Programming Course: Chapter Zero

Welcome to the **ESP32 Programming Course** repository! This repository serves as a guide, where we explore the theoretical foundations of the ESP32 module. If you're looking to get started with ESP32 development, this is the perfect place to begin.

---

## üìò Overview

In Chapter Zero, we cover the following topics:
- ESP32 Pinout, Datasheet, and Specifications.
- Key Features and Applications.
- ESP32 Modules and Development Boards.
- Communication Protocols.

This chapter provides the essential knowledge required to prepare for practical ESP32 programming in upcoming chapters.
