## üìç ESP32 Pinouts

ESP32 Development board features GPIO, ADC, DAC, and specialized pins for capacitive touch and low-power RTC modes.

### ESP32-WROOM-32 Pinout
![ESP32-WROOM-32 Pinout](screenshoot/ESP32_PINOUT.png)  
*The pinout diagram for the ESP32-WROOM-32.*

**GPIO:** Total 32 Multifunctional GPIOs are available on the ESP-Wroom-32 development board which can be used for input/output devices. Every GPIO pin can be configured as an internal pull-up, pull-down, or set to high impedance. The input can also be set to edge-trigger or level-trigger to generate CPU interrupts.

**Note:** GPIO34, GPIO35, GPIO36, and GPIO39 are the only input pins

### ESP32-ADC Pinout
![ESP32-ADC](screenshoot/ADC_GPIO.png)  
*The ADC pinout diagram for the ESP32-WROOM-32.*

**ADC:** On-chip 12-bit SAR (Successive Approximation Registers) ADCs (Analog to Digital Converter) which supports measurements on 16 channels of ESP32.

### ESP32-DAC Pinout
![ESP32-DAC](screenshoot/DAC_GPIO.png)  
*The DAC pinout diagram for the ESP32-WROOM-32.*

**DAC:** On-chip two 8-bit DAC (Digital to Analog) channels to produce digital signals into analog voltage signal outputs. Both DAC channels can also support independent conversions.

### ESP32-RTC GPIO Pinout

### ESP32-PWM GPIO Pinout
![ESP32-DAC](screenshoot/PWM_GPIO.png)  
*The PWM pinout diagram for the ESP32-WROOM-32.*

**PWM:** ESP32 development board has support 8-bit 32 channels PWM. The pins with the symbol ‚Äò~‚Äô represent that it has PWM support. It can be used for dimming LEDs or controlling motors etc.

### ESP32-Capacitive Touch Sensor
![ESP32-DAC](screenshoot/TOUCH_SENSOR.png)  
*The Capacitive Touch Sensor pinout diagram for the ESP32-WROOM-32.*

**TOUCH Pad:** ESP32 has 10 capacitive sensing GPIOs, that detect physical touch by the human body. This technique can replace mechanical buttons and switches to eliminate mechanical wear and tear

## üì° Communication Protocols

ESP32 supports the following communication protocols:
- **Wi-Fi** (802.11 b/g/n)
- **Bluetooth v4.2** (BR/EDR and BLE)
- **UART**, **SPI**, **I2C**, **I2S**, and **CAN**
- 
### ESP32- Uart GPIO
![ESP32-DAC](screenshoot/UART_GPIO.png)  
*The Uart gpio pinout diagram for the ESP32-WROOM-32.*

**UART:** ESP32 development board has two UART interfaces UART0 and UART1. Both provide asynchronous communication and support to RS232, RS485, and IrDA too.

**I2C:** The ESP32 development board has only one I2C bus interface (Supported in Arduino IDE). which can serve as an I2C master or slave, depending on the user‚Äôs configuration.

**The I2C interfaces support:**

- Standard mode Support (100 Kbit/s)
- Fast mode Support (400 Kbit/s)
- Support both 7-bit and 10-bit addressing modes
- Dual addressing mode

**SPI:** ESP32 has three SPIs which are SPI, HSPI, and VSPI. These SPIs also support the following general-purpose SPI features:

- Four modes of SPI transfer format (depend on the polarity and the phase of the SPI clock)
- Speed Up to 80 MHz 
- up to 64-byte FIFO

These features make it ideal for IoT and connected device applications.
